## Development Notes

This plugin uses multiple approaches to trigger the "Add Item by Identifier" function:
1. Direct ZoteroPane method call
2. Active Zotero pane method call
3. Menu item click simulation
4. Keyboard shortcut simulation
5. Internal utilities method call

Testing shows that approaches 3 (menu item click) and 4 (keyboard shortcut) are currently the most reliable methods.
